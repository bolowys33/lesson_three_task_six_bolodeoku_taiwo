## Design Choice & Build Process
### Design Choices
1. Responsive Layout: I chose to use Bootstrap to ensure that the portfolio website is responsive and looks good on various devices and screen sizes.
2. Minimalistic Design: I opted for a clean and minimalistic design to keep the focus on the content and showcase the portfolio items effectively.
3. Navbar Navigation: I included a navigation bar at the top of each page to allow easy navigation between different pages of the website.
4. Section Structure: I divided the website into separate sections such as Hero, About, Projects, and Contact for better organization and clarity.
5. Grid System: I used Bootstrap's grid system to create responsive and flexible layouts for different screen sizes.
6. Card Component: I utilized Bootstrap's card component to display the projects in a visually appealing manner.
### Building Process
1. Setting up the HTML Structure: I started by creating the basic HTML structure for each page, including the necessary Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files.
2. Navbar: I added a navigation bar to each page and configured the links to navigate to the respective pages.
3. Section Styling: I styled each section individually, using custom CSS to achieve the desired look and feel.
4. Content Integration: I added the relevant content, images, and text to each section, ensuring they are properly placed and formatted.
5. Responsive Design: I tested the website on different screen sizes and made adjustments to ensure it looks good and functions well on various devices.
